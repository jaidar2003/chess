# Chess

The aim of this development initiative is to create a chess game using the Python programming language, following the rules and principles outlined in the Wikipedia entry on the game. The resulting game will allow users to participate in chess matches via a text-based interface and will include functions for the game board, pieces, and move validity checking.
